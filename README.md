A simple to-do list using react.
<h1>To Do List</h1>

<h2>Functionality</h2>

<p>To do list boosts rather simple functionality with addition, deletion and crossing of an item only.</p>
<ul>
<li>Every time an item is added, it is stored inside an array and rendered using useState.</li>
<li>Deletion of an item depends on the unique id assigned to each item. Filter method is used to remove the clicked item.</li>
<li>While the line-through is rather similar to delete aside from the fact that it doesn't use filter but instead depends on the State.</li>
</ul>
